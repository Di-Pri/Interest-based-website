        <h1>Explore Bali</h1>
        <p>
          Bali is a favorite destination for many people around the world and it's easy to see why. Bali is a dream come true with its
          pristine beaches, rich culture, world-class dining destinations, and fantastic family attractions in every neighborhood. Whether
          you want a sun-soaked beach getaway, a relaxing spa break, an off-the-beaten-path adventure, or you just want to dine and shop
          your way across the island, there really is something for everyone. Bali feels like going on a never-ending adventure â€“ there is
          an activity to suit every soul.

        <h2>Tours and activities in Bali</h2>
        <div class="fle">
          <div>
            <h3>Surf waves</h3>
            <p>
              One of the main reasons people travel to Bali is to catch waves. The waves here are great for surfing, and depending on where
              you are on the island, they are geared for different levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Rent a scooter</h3>
            <p>
              Renting a motorbike is pretty easy in Bali and very cheap, and it saves time in traffic. If you don't feel comfortable driving
              yourself, you can use the GO-JEK app for a taxi-like service but on the back of a motorbike.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Go to rice fields of Ubud</h3>
            <p>
              Who would have expected a simple rice field to be so beautiful? And just because you have seen one rice field doesn't mean you
              have seen them all. The Balinese use a unique system of irrigation that gives their rice fields a distinct beauty.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Visit Monkey Forest in Ubud</h3>
            <p>
              Ubud is known for its forest home to hundreds of monkeys, but be careful! Some of the monkeys can be aggressive towards
              tourists, especially if you make eye contact and don't have any food.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Travel beyond Ubud</h3>
            <p>
              Bali is more than Seminyak and Ubud. Get off the beaten track and venture to the north of the island. You will find fewer
              crowds, remote temples, and plenty of beautiful waterfalls to explore.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Trek Mount Batur</h3>
            <p>
              The sunrise hike up <a href="Mount-Batur.html"> Mount Batur</a> is famous in Bali. Locally considered to be a sacred mountain,
              Batur is an active volcano. It's totally safe and a must-see for any nature lover.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Enjoy sunsets</h3>
            <p>
              Bali has its own sunset culture. Every evening, many people gather on the beaches, and everyone is waiting for the sunset.
              Someone walks along the coast, someone just sits on the sand. But no one is in a hurry.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Take a day trip from Bali</h3>
            <p>
              Nusa Penida is a relatively underdeveloped island located south-east of Bali. While it lacks the trendy restaurants and beach
              clubs, you will find incredible natural beauty.
