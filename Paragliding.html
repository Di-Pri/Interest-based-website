        <h1>Paragliding in Bali</h1>
        <p>
          Paragliding requires one to jump off a hill with nothing on your back but some lightweight fabric. The pilot sits in a harness
          suspended below a fabric wing comprising a large number of interconnected baffled cells. Wing shape is maintained by the
          suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over
          the outside. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand
          meters.

            <h3>Paragliding tour</h3>
            <p>
              Anyone can experience paragliding in Bali by doing a tandem flight with an instructor. Most paragliding tours will take you
              about 100 meters high and fly for around 20 minutes. In order to paraglide, the wind has to be at optimum conditions.

            <h3>The flight</h3>
            <p>
              Standing at the edge of the mountain and looking down was scary. After a short run, we started flying. It was a magnificent
              view and an exciting experience to be so high up in the sky. It was the first time when I tried it, and I definitely enjoyed
              it.
