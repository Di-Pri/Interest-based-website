        <h1>Mount Batur</h1>
        <p>
          Mount Batur is the second-largest active volcano in Bali after Mount Agung, surrounded by a lake and various mountains. Lake Batur
          is the largest lake in Bali. The volcano first erupted 30,000 years ago and it is still known as one of the largest eruptions on
          earth. The scenery on top is simply breathtaking, and if you manage to climb up here early in the morning, you will be rewarded in
          every way.

            <h3>How to get to Mount Batur?</h3>
            <p>
              The volcano is located in Bali's north part, around 40 km from Ubud and a 1,5 hours drive by car. There are tours offered from
              most places on the island. On average, you should expect to pay â‚¬ 15-20 per person.

            <h3>The tour to Mount Batur</h3>
            <p>
              In the early morning, you will be picked up from your accommodation and taken to the foot of the volcano. Most tours offer a
              breakfast stop. Then you will be equipped with a flashlight and start trekking.

            <h3>At the top</h3>
            <p>
              At the top, you're greeted by packs of Balinese monkeys eager to share your sunrise and your snacks. Even if you associate
              Bali with tropical temperatures, the complete opposite is true at the top of the Mt. Batur. It is freezing cold there.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>How hard is it?</h3>
            <p>
              The total distance for trekking Mount Batur is around 10 km there and back, depending on which trail you take. There is a
              harder route and an easier route. If you want a harder volcano hike than Batur with fewer crowds, consider doing the Mount
              Agung hike in the same area.
